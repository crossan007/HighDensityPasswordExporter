# HighDensityPasswordExporter
A KeePass plugin for generating near-raw serializations of KeePass data structures designed for printing/archival.


## Why?

I wanted to print out my personal password store, but the built-in print functionality was taking too many pages due to lots of white space on the page.

This project lets me print out JSON blobs separated by Markdown headings for each KeePass group in my database
